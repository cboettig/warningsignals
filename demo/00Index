ibm_sims              Simulate data using the individual-based model of a saddle-node bifurcation
mcmc                  Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit of the models
plots                 Regenerate all plots for the manuscript from saved data files
roc_figure            Figure to explain how ROC curves are created
sampling_freq         Increase the sampling frequency to show an increase in power
simulate_data         Simulate a realization of stable and unstable data from the linear models
analysis              3 functions for applying all the analysis to data set.  Not a demo, but called from the *_analysis scripts.
